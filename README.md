# Strangerthings_Lightshow
 
// By Dan Morrone
// Based on the work previously done by Steve: https://gist.github.com/steveosoule/f9d98b58ae666bce6a6752cefa2d11aa
// Wiring: http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Based-Stranger-Things-Lights/ 
// The wire diagram shows four wires in the band. My model of WS8211 has 3 bands, and I found the one in the middle was the signal wire.)
